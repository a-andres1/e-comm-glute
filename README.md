# e-comm-glute
For this project I created a database and CRUD routes to create, update and delete information on the database. 

## Description
We were tasked to create a backend for an e-commerce site. At first I was pretty intimidated, but once I got in there the task was less intimidating than I originally thought. 

The routes came together pretty quickly once I started and I was excited to see them working in postman. 

As I was doing this homework, how I was supposed to call the responses from the database finally clicked. I've felt like I'm stumbling around for a few weeks, so I was very relieved once that started making sense. 

## Technologies Used
